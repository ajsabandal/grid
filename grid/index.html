                    Not only is the Beagle an excellent hunting dog and loyal companion, it is also happy-go-lucky, funny, and—thanks to its
                    pleading expression—cute. They were bred to hunt in packs, so they enjoy company and are generally easygoing.

                    The Rottweiler is a robust working breed of great strength descended from the mastiffs of the Roman legions. A gentle playmate

                    An ancient Japanese breed, the Shiba Inu is a little but well-muscled dog once employed as a hunter. Today, the spirited,
                    good-natured Shiba is the most popular companion dog in Japan. The adaptable Shiba is at home in town
                    or country.

                    That face! Those big dark eyes looking up at you with that sweet expression! It’s no surprise that Shih Tzu owners have been
                    so delighted with this little “Lion Dog” for a thousand years. Where Shih Tzu go, giggles and mischief
                    follow.
